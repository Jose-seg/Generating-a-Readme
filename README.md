# Generating a README 

## Description
The purpose of my backend app is to generate a README file in the terminal using node.js and various types of packages
to ensure we are able to make it functional. Through a series of prompts the user would answer about the readme they're generating 
, and after they finish it should generate a new readme file with the information they provided.

## Usage 
Given that a user wants to generate a quick professional readme, a series of prompts will be provided to the user to answer
, and when they answer all the questions then a readme file should generate in the workspace area with all the given 
information the user provided.
